# Tokenized Regulatory Compliance Audit Management System

A decentralized blockchain-based system for managing regulatory compliance audits with tokenized incentives and transparent tracking.

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing regulatory compliance audits in a decentralized manner. It enables organizations to coordinate audits, monitor compliance status, plan audit activities, manage findings, and track remediation efforts through blockchain technology.

## Key Features

### üîç Audit Coordinator Verification
- Validates and manages regulatory audit coordinators
- Role-based access control for audit personnel
- Credential verification and authorization tracking

### üìä Compliance Monitoring
- Real-time compliance status tracking
- Automated compliance score calculations
- Historical compliance data preservation

### üìÖ Audit Planning
- Structured audit scheduling and planning
- Resource allocation and timeline management
- Stakeholder coordination and notifications

### üîé Finding Management
- Comprehensive audit finding documentation
- Severity classification and prioritization
- Finding lifecycle tracking from discovery to resolution

### üîß Remediation Tracking
- Action item creation and assignment
- Progress monitoring and status updates
- Completion verification and validation

## System Architecture

The system consists of five interconnected modules:

1. **Coordinator Module** - Manages audit personnel verification and authorization
2. **Monitoring Module** - Tracks ongoing compliance status and metrics
3. **Planning Module** - Handles audit scheduling and resource coordination
4. **Finding Module** - Documents and manages audit discoveries
5. **Remediation Module** - Tracks corrective actions and their completion

## Token Economics

The system utilizes a native token for:
- Incentivizing audit participation
- Rewarding timely remediation efforts
- Staking mechanisms for coordinator verification
- Governance participation in system updates
